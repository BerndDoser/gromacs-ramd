Fix missing CPU-GPU synchronization when doing free-energy calculations
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When GPU halo exchange with direct communication is enabled, CPU based 
free-energy kernels were being run without waiting on non-local co-ordinates 
to be available on host. This resulted in use of stale data on CPU side. 
This issue can cause incorect output when GPU direct communication is enabled 
using GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM environment variable and simulation contains 
free-energy calculations.
