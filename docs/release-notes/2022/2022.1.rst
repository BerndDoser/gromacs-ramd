GROMACS 2022.1 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2022. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
previous 2022 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2021.5 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without the
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed incorrect pairlist buffer with test particle insertion
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With TPI the pairlist cut-off did not take into account rtpi and the radius
of the molecule to insert.

:issue:`4458`

Remove false positives for missing exclusions in free energy kernels
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Free energy calculations good stop with a fatal error stating that excluded
atoms pairs were beyond the pairlist cut-off while this actually was not the case.

:issue:`4321`

Fix crash when steering FEP with AWH without PME or with separate PME rank
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There would be a segfault when deciding whether early PME results are needed.

:issue:`4413`

Fix bug with reporting energies for groups
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When different molecules in a molecule block in the topology use different
energy group assignments for atoms, the energy group assignment of the
first molecule would be repeated for all other molecules in the block.
Note that the reported energies for the whole system were correct.

:issue:`4462`

Fix missing B State pinning for PME GPU
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The PME memory is now correctly pinned when using GPU PME.

:issue:`4408`

Only allow 1D PME GPU decomposition
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Due to correctness issues in PME grid reduction with 1D decomposition, this feature could produce
incorrect results. This would however in most real-world cases be masked by an overly large halo size.
0D decomposition cases are unaffected and only such setups will be allowed in the current release
(0D PME decomposition can be forced using the GMX_PMEONEDD env var).

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use correct scattering length for hydrogens in ``gmx sans``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The floating-point comparison was always false, leading to all atoms with
atomic number 1 having scattering length of deuterium (6.6710 fm) instead
of -3.7406 fm for plain hydrogens.

Fix C-terminal residue patch for charmm
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

One of the atom types names in the Charmm27 force field C-terminal
COOH patch was incorrect, and would have triggered a crash or error
in pdb2gmx, which was identified when Fedora ran our unit tests with
additional checking flags.

:issue:`4414`

Add polyproline helix coloring to DSSP maps
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

DSSP-4.0 can detect polyproline type-2 helices, so we now also
have a dark blue-green color entry for this in the generated maps.

:issue:`4410`

Remove option -unsat from gmx order and document deficiencies
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This hasn't properly worked since it was added.

:issue:`1166`

Fix g96 file writing
""""""""""""""""""""

The g96 file writing could violate the file format when residue or atom names
got longer than 5 characters.

:issue:`4456`

Rerun will no longer abort when encountering too high forces
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4352`

Allow incomplete index files for extract-cluster
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4420`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix nvcc flag detection
"""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4415`

Fix issue in GMXRC.bash
"""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4450`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed regression test download URL for forks of |Gromacs|
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Users of forks of |Gromacs| (eg PLUMED) can now also use the feature
to download the regression tests automatically.

Fix internal nblib test failure
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The nblib internal tests used incorrect indices, which triggered a crash
when Fedora ran our unit tests with additional checking flags. This will
not have influenced any actual clients merely using nblib.

:issue:`4414`

Workaround for nested MPI-aware code
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:py:mod:`gmxapi` scripts containing `gmxapi.commandline_operation` tasks could be unusable if a task
executable automatically detects MPI resources and the script is invoked with an MPI launcher.

The workaround is to increase the isolation of the task environment from the parent process by explicitly
setting the task environment variables.
This is now possible with a new *env* key word argument to :py:func:`~gmxapi.commandline_operation`,
which is simply passed along to `subprocess.run`.

:issue:`4421`

Accurately checks when FEP lambda might go over 1 or under 0
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The checks that verify that the FEP lambda does not go out of
range used to trigger incorrectly when the delta-lambda and number
of step was exactly right.

:issue:`4442`

Correct free-energy (de)coupling integrator check
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With free-energy (de)coupling calculations, grompp would only warn
with the md integrator that sd should be used. Now this warning
is extended to the md-vv integrators.
