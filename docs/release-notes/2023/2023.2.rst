Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

gmxapi.commandline_operation environment variable filtering
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A new utility (:py:func:`gmxapi.runtime.filtered_mpi_environ()`) is available
to remove MPI-related environment variables from :py:data:`os.environ`, such as
to prepare the subprocess environment of `gmxapi.commandline_operation`.

This is a follow-up to :issue:`4423`, for which the original fix appeared to be insufficient.

:issue:`4736`

build-dependent checking for gmxapi runtime arguments
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Depending on whether |Gromacs| was built with MPI support or thread-MPI support,
some :doc:`/onlinehelp/gmx-mdrun` options are not defined.
Such errors may only appear in the MD log file,
and can thus be hard to identify in API use cases.

Additional checking has been added to :py:func:`gmxapi.simulation.workflow.from_tpr`
to try to preempt user errors,
and additional usage notes have been added to `gmxapi.mdrun`.

:issue:`4771`
