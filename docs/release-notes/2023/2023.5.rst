GROMACS 2023.5 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2024. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in |Gromacs| since the
previous 2023.4 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2022.6 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use RDTIME instead of RDCYCLE on RISC-V
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Starting with Linux 6.6, the ``rdcycle`` instruction cannot be called from
userland for security reasons, making |Gromacs| fail with ``SIGILL``.
Now it is replaced with ``rdtime``.
