Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Freezing AWH simulations with multiple MPI ranks per walker
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

AWH simulations with biases shared by multiple walkers and using
multiple MPI ranks per walker would hang when outputting energy,
i.e., already at step 0.

There would not be any incorrect results.

:issue:`4925`

With AWH for FE, mdrun could exit with an assertion failure
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The would happen e.g. when using soft-core only for LJ, whereas it was
also needed for Coulomb. Now a proper error message is generated.

:issue:`4938`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|Gromacs| error messages no longer include broken links
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Two error messages used to contain links to the contents that are no longer
available on the |Gromacs| website. These links have been replaced with the
links to the relevant pages in the current documentation.

Fixed a segmentation fault in grompp with AWH and FEP without FEP states
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4932`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed compilation with Boost 1.83
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4909`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
