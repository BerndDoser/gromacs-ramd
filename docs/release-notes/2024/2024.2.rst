Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Improve error messages from editconf and trjconv
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fail properly if a tpr file is not supplied when using the -conect option.
Also avoid a "File input/output error:" when no tpr file is supplied when
it is required for -pbc options.

:issue:`5032`

Avoid floating point exception with corrupted xtc files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Reading a corrupted xtc file could cause a floating point exception.
Now the gmx binary will exit with an error message.

:issue:`5037`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable usage of Intel compiler with AVX-512 SIMD on AMD Zen 4
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The fix is to use newer style compiler flags for Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++
Compiler and AVX-512. Older style flag ``-xCORE-AVX512`` supports only
Intel CPUs, while newer style ``-march=skylake-avx512`` additionally
supports AMD CPUs. This fixes building with Intel compiler on AMD CPUs
with Zen 4 cores.

:issue:`5043`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NBLIB always used geometric Lennard-Jones combination rules
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now NBLIB detects the Lennard-Jones combination rules (or none)
from the Lennard-Jones parameters set by the user.

:issue:`5015`

Fix Performance Regression for Some Cases on Latest NVIDIA GPUs
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In version 2024.0 we included optimizations to non-bonded force
calculations on NVIDIA GPUs which improved performance for a range of
cases, through loop unrolling tuning. Here, we tweak the optimization
to fix a regression in a specific case, which was discovered to be
caused by this tuning.

:issue:`4867`

Address performance regression on ARM with clang and SVE
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The non-bonded CPU SIMD kernels contained loops which were not unrolled,
in particular with the LLVM backend of clang on ARM SVE. Other combinations
of compilers and architectures might also have been affected.
Note that there are still other performance regressions in certain versions
of these kernels on multiple platforms.

:issue:`5036`
       
Fix crash in NbnxmSetupTest.CanCreateNbnxmGPU
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``NbnxmSetupTest.CanCreateNbnxmGPU`` could crash in GPU builds
with an error in ``freeDeviceBuffer`` function during pairlist
deinitialization.

:issue:`4888`

Fix incorrect mdp keyword for mass repartioning in documentation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The mdp keyword for mass repartioning was incorrect in the list of mdp
options in the documentation.

:issue:`5007`

Report AdaptiveCpp/hipSYCL compiler path in ``gmx -version``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In 2024.0 and 2024.1 it was empty.

:issue:`5045`
