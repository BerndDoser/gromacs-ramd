Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

mdrun now computes the initial bonded distancs with periodic molecules
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using periodic molecules, mdrun could quit with an error message
about multiple assignments of bonded interactions telling the user to
report the issue. The actual source of this was that mdrun did not
determine the communication distance required for bonded interactions.
Now this distance is determined.

:issue:`5086`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Permit ``gmx tune_pme`` to understand ``md.log`` files
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The format of ``md.log`` files changed in 2024 which broke the ability of
``gmx tune_pme`` to understand how previous runs worked by parsing that
file. Now ``gmx tune_pme`` understands better.

Avoid crash of convert-tpr on velocity-less tpr files 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The convert-tpr now works on tpr files that do not contain velocities,
as generated for, e.g., energy minimization.

:issue:`5080`

Avoid premature termination when using ``gmx hbond``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fixed an error that caused gmx hbond to prematurely terminate if there were no donors or acceptors of hydrogen bonds in the chosen selection.
