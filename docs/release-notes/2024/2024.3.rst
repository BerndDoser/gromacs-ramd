Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Permit ``gmx tune_pme`` to understand ``md.log`` files
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The format of ``md.log`` files changed in 2024 which broke the ability of
``gmx tune_pme`` to understand how previous runs worked by parsing that
file. Now ``gmx tune_pme`` understands better.

Avoid crash of convert-tpr on velocity-less tpr files 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The convert-tpr now works on tpr files that do not contain velocities,
as generated for, e.g., energy minimization.
