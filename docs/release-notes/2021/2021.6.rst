Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extend error message for free-energy exclusion beyond rlist
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With free-energy decoupling simulations an error for exclusions beyond rlist
can occur due to a too small box. This cause is now added to the error
message.

:issue:`3403`
:issue:`3808`


Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do not try to guess atom names in ``gmx rms`` unless needed
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Guessing atomic masses based on atom names may sometimes fail.
When ``-nomw`` switch is used, atom masses are not needed, but ``gmx rms``
was trying to guess them anyway, throwing a fatal error when an unknown 
element was encountered. Now, the error is only raised when masses are
actually needed.

:issue:`4356`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Corrects units for AWH interval in the user guide
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When applying AWH to angles or dihedrals, the units of bonds of the sampling
interval listed in the mdp section of the user guide are now stated to be
in degrees. The guide incorrectly stated that there were in radians, whereas
the code interprets the user input as degrees.
